There are no requirements to execute the use case described in the paper besides a functioning maude installation:

1. **Install Maude** 3.5 or higher according to the [installation instructions](https://maude.cs.illinois.edu/wiki/Maude_download_and_installation).
   To run Maude on Windows, we recommend the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

2. **Test your Maude installation** by running the following command (WSL or Linux):
```bash
maude
```

It should return the following (Version 3.5 or higher):

```text
‚ùØ maude
                     \||||||||||||||||||/
                   --- Welcome to Maude ---
                     /||||||||||||||||||\
             Maude 3.5 built: Sep 25 2024 12:00:00
