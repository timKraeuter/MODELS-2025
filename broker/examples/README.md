# Examples
This folder contains examples used to test our approach:
- ``run-async.maude``: Run a BPMN/SC combination of models communicating asynchronously (see [``./BPMN_SC_async/async_async.pdf``](./BPMN_SC_async/async_async.pdf)).
- ``run-cpn.maude``: Run a CPN that relies on the broker to move some tokens (see [``./CPN_async/img.png``](./CPN_async/img.png)).
- ``run-lts-sync``: Run a LTS/LTS combination of models communicating synchronously through the broker (work in progress, see [``./LTS_sync/lts.svg``](./LTS_sync/lts.svg)).
- ``run-lts-sync-data1``: Run a LTS/LTS combination of models communicating synchronously through the broker including data passing (work in progress).
- ``run-lts-sync-data2``: Run a LTS/LTS combination of models communicating synchronously through the broker including data passing (work in progress).
