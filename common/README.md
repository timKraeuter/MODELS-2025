- Contains the real-time maude module (Real-Time Maude 2.4).
- **common.maude**: Defines the global system (sort System) and the tick rule which advances global time until the maximal time bound (eq TIME-BOUND).
The tick rule makes use of the delta and mte function as explained in "Semantics and pragmatics of Real-Time Maude".
