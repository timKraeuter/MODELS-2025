### Artifact Evaluated (Functional & Reusable)

**Reasoning:**
The artifacts are relevant for chapter V where we describe the implementation of our approach.
They show how to check the properties 1 and 2 described in chapter V and that they are fulfilled for the use case (see output for `maude run-use-case.maude`).
Furthermore, they are reusable by installing Maude on either Windows or Linux and running the provided commands after downloading the artifacts.
Finally, there are additional README.md files in all top-level directories that describe the content of each directory in more detail.

### Artifact Available

**Reasoning:**
The artifacts are permanently publicly available through Zenodo including a DOI.
